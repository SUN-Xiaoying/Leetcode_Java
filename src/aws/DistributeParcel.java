// Amazon wants to distribute parcels among delivery agents in a way that minimizes the maximum number of parcels any single agent has to deliver. You're given:

// An integer array parcels[], where parcels[i] is the number of parcels currently assigned to the i-th agent.
// An integer extra_parcels, which is the number of parcels that need to be distributed among the agents.
// The goal is to find the minimum possible value of the maximum number of parcels any agent has after distributing the extra_parcels

// Example:
// Input:

// parcels = [7, 5, 1, 9, 1]
// extra_parcels = 25

// Output: 10
public class DistributeParcel {
    // TODO Make Every Num the same as The Max
    // Evenly distributed the rest
}
